Implementations to be done


Essential:

- Save data to .xls

- Check Axis Range logic

- When start is pressed:
	if filename== "Add costum filename label":
		Change it to a <unique_name>.xls
	else:
		keep text in filename as name for the file
	
	Same logic for filepath!

- Sort-out color function for labels, background color is being change, foreground color also needs to be changed to assure readibility 
	? same function that is implemented for background can be used for foreground ?

Consider:

+ Add vizualization multiplier to variable ?
